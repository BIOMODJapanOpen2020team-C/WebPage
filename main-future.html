                    We started by hypothesising the feasibility of creating a network of chemical reactions capable
                    of operating in a manner similar to the human immune system, using DNA-DNA interactions as simplified
                    artificial analogues to mimic the adaptive immune system's macroscopic behaviours in humans. Therefore,
                    it has been shown that the engineered artificial immune response superficially mimics three basic steps
                    of the host immune response, namely recognition and tolerance, immune response, and killing and memory,
                    of which we have managed to simulate two steps but without any living component being present to achieve
                    functionality. In addition, even though the engineered device is completely synthetic, its ability to use
                    only biological molecules (DNA) has shown biocompatibility. Consequently, because DNA or RNA can regulate
                    the cellular state, it may be possible to encode cellular functions to the output of the device (i.e. the
                    DNA and/or RNA strand), which makes it possible to scale this prototype up to increasingly smart molecular
                    nano controllers and nano-operators. Our current construction style, however, would need to be enhanced and
                    combined with other chemistries to achieve this.
